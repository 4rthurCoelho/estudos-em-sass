# Studies in Sass

This repository is essentially the place where I'm going to store my studies in Sass on my way to mastering this technology.

## Requirements

- Node.js

## How to run the project?

1) Go to the main directory of the project, run:

    `cd tutorial-inicial-sass`

2) Run the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies of the project:

3) Then, run the command `http-server`, so you can open the project in your browser by the address **http://localhost:8080**

- If you want another specific port to run the server, run the command `http-server -p "preferred port"`

## How to to compile the css?

1) In the main directory, run the command `sass sass/styles.sass css/styles.css`

- Tip: To not have to go to the terminal and run the command above everytime that you do a change in the Sass file, run the command `sass sass/styles.sass css/styles.css --watch`
